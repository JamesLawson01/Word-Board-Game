If you are successful, your opponent loses the score for that turn, and the tiles are returned to them. If you are unsuccessful, the game continues as normal. Your opponent may challenge your words as well!</TextBlock>

            <TextBlock Margin="5" Foreground="White" TextWrapping="Wrap">Once you have completed your turn, click the Finish Turn button, and your opponent takes their turn.</TextBlock>

            <TextBlock Margin="5" Foreground="White" TextWrapping="Wrap">You may skip a turn by pressing the Finish Turn button without doing anything else.</TextBlock>

            <TextBlock Margin="5" Foreground="White" TextWrapping="Wrap">The game ends once all tiles have been placed, or when there are no more valid moves left.</TextBlock>

            <TextBlock Margin="5" Foreground="White" TextWrapping="Wrap">Scores are updated each turn. Letter scores are indicated on each tile, and bonuses are shown on the gameboard. Each bonus can only be used once. Your score comes from letters you placed on that turn, plus any letters placed by your opponent included in words you formed.</TextBlock>
